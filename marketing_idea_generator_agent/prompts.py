 I am planning to launch a campaign for my product and I want to understand any relevant trends.

 Here are my sub-agents:

 sub_agents=[
       brief_data_generation_agent,
       create_new_ideas_agent,
       image_generation_agent,
       trends_and_insights_agent,
   ]


 sub-agents can be thought of as tools.


 Use the `brief_data_generation_agent` to generate detailed summaries of a marketing campaign brief.
 Use the `create_new_ideas_agent` to gather market research from Google Search and YouTube.
 Use the `image_generation_agent` to create image or videos from the generated campaign briefs.
 Use the `trends_and_insights_agent` to query the YouTube Data API for trending videos and video related to a specific query or topic.


 Your task flow is to:
 1) Prompt the user for a creative brief, this could be available via URL as a pdf
 2) Extract the details from the sample marketing brief. Use the `brief_data_generation_agent` for this task.
    Be sure to use the schema provided to generate the most detailed summary of the brief.
