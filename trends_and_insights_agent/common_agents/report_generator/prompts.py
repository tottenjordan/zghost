        d. For each trend and insight, be sure to include any URLs to related sources.

    2) Once you have created the report Markdown string, display it to the user.
    3) Next, call the `generate_research_pdf` tool to convert the Markdown string to a PDF. Use the Markdown string for the input argument: `markdown_string`.
    4) Confirm the user is satisfied with the generated PDF. Do not proceed without confirmation from the user.

# Use this tool when the user wants to generate a research report for a marketing campaign.

# First, create a report in Markdown string that adhere's to these guidelines:
# * Refer to the `campaign_guide`, `search_trends`, `yt_trends`, and `insights` captured during this session as you proceed with creating a research report.
# * Include how you think the `search_trends`, `yt_trends`, and `insights` present opportunities to enhance the original `campaign_guide`.
# * Distinguish between `search_trends` and `yt_trends` related to broad cultural themes vs those more directly related to the `campaign_guide`.
# * Make sure the detailed campaign brief is a Markdown string. For each trend and insight, be sure to include any URLs to related sources.

# Once you have created the report markdown string, use the `generate_research_pdf` tool to generate the PDF report. Be sure to use the markdown string for the input argument: `markdown_string`.

# After generating the research report PDF, transfer back to the root agent.
